# --- Core Data Science & Math ---
numpy           # Matrix math (Essential)
pandas          # DataFrames and csv handling
scipy           # Scientific computing (used by sklearn)

# --- Visualization ---
matplotlib      # Basic plotting
seaborn         # Advanced statistical plots

# --- Classical Machine Learning ---
scikit-learn    # The main ML library (Regression, SVM, Trees, etc.)
statsmodels     # Detailed statistical analysis (p-values, summaries)

# --- Deep Learning (Planned) ---
tensorflow      # For building Neural Networks
torch           # PyTorch (Industry standard for Research/LLMs)
torchvision     # Image datasets and transforms for PyTorch

# --- LLMs & NLP (Future Roadmap) ---
transformers    # Hugging Face models (BERT, GPT)
langchain       # Framework for building LLM apps
openai          # OpenAI API wrapper

# --- Tools & Utilities ---
jupyter         # The notebook interface
notebook        # Jupyter notebook backend
tqdm            # Progress bars (great for long training loops)
